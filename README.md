# FrontendMentor.io Challenge

## Landing page with curved sections

In this project I'm trying to improve my CSS and semantic HTML skills. And also I'm using this to practice and for fun too! Because I love this kind of challenges.

In this project I'm using:

* CSS variables
* ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to resolve the curved sections
* Embedding and modifying SVG images
* Mobile First
